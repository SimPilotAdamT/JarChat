# JarChat
An IRC client written entirely in Java.

This is ***__very__*** work in progress at the moment, and while having the help would be nice, it is being developed as a part of my A-Level Computer Science course and as such no pull request made before July 2022 will be merged. You are free to use and download all of my code, assuming you follow the terms of the GNU GPL v3 License but that is it. You are also allowed to, in fact encouraged to test and report back any bugs you may find in JarChat in the [issues tab](https://github.com/SimPilotAdamT/JarChat/issues) and I will act on them as I see fit.

Ignore the `AQA Req'd Documentation` folder unless you are from the exam board ***__or__*** you are my Computer Science teacher (or you're a student from the future as of July 2022 who needs some help with documentation). Once I complete my A-Level course all source code and documentation will still be available and tagged as `v1.0` (all releases made beforehand will be marked as `v0.x` prereleae betas.
